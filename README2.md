## Overview

[Back to top](#mileston-1-project---anthony-jones-handyman)

This website is for educational purposes only. I originally planned to make this site for a real builder, but due to poor responsiveness, I've made it for an imaginary handyman.

## UX

### Strategy

[Back to top](#mileston-1-project---anthony-jones-handyman)

This website is for a builder/handyman, with the aim of functioning essentially as an extended business card.

Handyman's goals...
- wants to be found
- wants the platform to inspire sense of **trust** and reliability in potential clients
- wants a means of receiving quote requests. This could potentially save the handyman time driving to sites if potential clients can submit pictures along with a description

Buyer's goals...
- wants to find a good builder
- wants **assurance** as to handyman's quality and character
- wants a convenient means of contacting the handyman and of requesting quotes for jobs, with the possibility of fewer home visits if pictures can be sent as well

Target audience
- homeowners, the majority without subject expertise
- property managers, who will probably have a variety of tasks to do on a regular basis

Unique selling proposition
- Anthony Jones is an experienced builder who charges reasonable prices, as opposed to most other tradesmen whose prices still remain high after the demand of the COVID era

Considerations
- Unlike B2C interactions, which depend more on impulsive decision making on the part of customers, hiring a builder is more like a B2B consideration. This is because hiring a builder is more of a serious commitment, both financially and because one has to live with the result thereafter. For this reason, providing assurance is paramount.
- Unlike a B2B interaction however, most customers are not industry experts and don't fully understand the problem, the solution or best practice. It is well known that among builders there are many 'cowboys' and those who will try to overcharge as much as possible. For this reason, it is vital that the site instills a positive emotional response in potential customers that inspires trust.

Given that in today's age, business is advertised and found via websites, the creation of a website is fully justified to fulfil the requirements above, if not essential.
