# Mileston 1 Project - Anthony Jones Builder
###### By Gareth Llewelyn

## Strategy

This website is for a builder/handyman to function essentially as an extended business card.

The handyman...
- Wants to be found
- Wants the platform to inspire sense of **trust** and reliability in potential clients
- Wants a means of receiving quote requests

The buyer...
- wants to find a good builder
- wants **assurance** as to handyman's quality and character
- wants a convenient means of contacting the handyman and of requesting quotes for jobs

Considerations
- Unlike B2C interactions, which depend more on impulsive decision making on the part of customers, hiring a builder is more like a B2B consideration. This is because hiring a builder is more of a serious commitment, both financially and because one has to live with the result thereafter. For this reason, providing assurance is paramount.
- Unlike a B2B interaction however, most customers are not industry experts and don't fully understand the problem, the solution or best practice. It is well known that among builders there are many 'cowboys' and those who will try to overcharge as much as possible. For this reason, it is vital that the site instills a positive emotional response in potential customers that inspires trust.
- Given how important trust is, with the goal of a long term relationship that hopefully lead to more jobs, honesty is important. This has implications for presentation also. If I made a super slick, shiny and ‘professional’ site, the customer may feel somewhat catfished if someone turns up a bit late, in trackies, cracking a smile front and back. I would rather the site were a bit more subtle, down to earth, what it says on the tin kind of thing.
