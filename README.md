# Mileston 1 Project - Anthony Jones Builder
###### By Gareth Llewelyn

## Strategy

This website is for a builder/handyman to function essentially as an extended business card.

The handyman...
- Wants to be found
- Wants the platform to inspire sense of **trust** and reliability in potential clients
- Wants a means of receiving quote requests

The buyer...
- wants to find a good builder
- wants **assurance** as to handyman's quality and character
- wants a convenient means of contacting the handyman and of requesting quotes for jobs

Considerations
- Unlike B2C interactions, which depend more on impulsive decision making on the part of customers, hiring a builder is more like a B2B consideration. This is because hiring a builder is more of a serious commitment, both financially and because one has to live with the result thereafter. For this reason, providing assurance is paramount.
- Unlike a B2B interaction however, most customers are not industry experts and don't fully understand the problem, the solution or best practice. It is well known that among builders there are many 'cowboys' and those who will try to overcharge as much as possible. For this reason, it is vital that the site instills a positive emotional response in potential customers that inspires trust.
- Given how important trust is, with the goal of a long term relationship that hopefully lead to more jobs, honesty is important. This has implications for presentation also. If I made a super slick, shiny and ‘professional’ site, the customer may feel somewhat catfished if someone turns up a bit late, in trackies, cracking a smile front and back. I would rather the site were a bit more subtle, down to earth, what it says on the tin kind of thing.

## Scope

1) What the customer says they need - a builder
2) What the customer actually needs - a good value, trustworthy builder
3) What the customer doesn't know they need - a long term contact who can offer other home-improvements that may be more affordable than previously realised

This site will act as an extended business card and will include information about

- Services offered
- Experience
- Character
- Contact details
- Job quote request form

User stories

- Old granny needs help with a leaky tap. Finds clear, easy to use, reassuring website.
- A home-owner who usually turns to DIY to save money needs help with a problem above his skill level, or a problem he has no time to deal with.

## Structure

Information needs to convey what (services), who (experience and character), how (contact) and how much (quote request form). Given that our strategy has set out to instill trust, this order makes sense for our site's pages. 

Given that the customer getting in contact is the desired outcome, the contact information will always be visible in the footer, as will the 'Get Quote' call to action, one click away.

The information will be structured as follows:

### Header 

1) Name
2) Nav bar

### Footer 

1) Contact details
2) Base location
3) **Call to action** (Get Quote!)
4) Check a trade
5) Instagram
6) My GitHub?

### Home page

1) Immediately understandable summary/hook.
2) Provided services (categories, examples, and pics)

### About page

1) Background, history, experience
2) Ethos, customer care
3) Testimonials

### Contact

1) Get quote form (Job description, attach pics, customer details, submit button)
2) Contact details 
3) Map with base location and operating radius
